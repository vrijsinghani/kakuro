# Chapter 11: Master Class

You've proven yourself capable. Now prove you're exceptional.

The 13×13 grids in this chapter separate casual solvers from dedicated puzzle masters. Every technique you've learned will be tested.

## The Challenge Increases

-   **Intricate Constraint Networks:** Runs interweave in complex patterns. One mistake cascades.
-   **Minimal Givens:** Fewer obvious starting cells. You must create your own footholds.
-   **Mental Stamina:** These puzzles demand sustained focus over 40+ minutes.

## Master Techniques

-   **Intersection Analysis:** When two long runs cross, the overlap often reveals the only valid digit.
-   **Elimination Chains:** Sometimes you must prove what CAN'T go somewhere before discovering what can.
-   **Verify Continuously:** Check your work after each cell—errors compound quickly.

Trust your training. You have the skills. Now apply them.
