## Technical Specifications

- **Format:** PNG with high-quality rendering
- **Resolution:** High-resolution for print (suitable for 300 DPI printing)

- **Font Size:** Large print optimized for 50-70 age demographic
- **File Size:** 73-214 KB per diagram (optimized for both print and digital)

## 📐 Diagram 2 Two-Page Split

**Why the split?**
The original diagram_2.png (1200 × 4930 pixels) measures 16.43" tall at 300 DPI—far too tall for a single 8.5" × 11" page. To maintain print quality and readability for our target 50-70 age demographic, we split it into two pages.

**Split Details:**
- **Split Point:** Pixel 2,465 (after Grid 2)
- **Page 1 (diagram_2_page1.png):**
  - Dimensions: 1200 × 2465 pixels
  - Physical size: 4.00" × 8.22" at 300 DPI
  - Content: Grids 1-2 (Introduction and ACROSS analysis)
  - File size: 151 KB
  - ✅ Fits comfortably on 8.5" × 11" with margins (1.28" vertical clearance)

- **Page 2 (diagram_2_page2.png):**
  - Dimensions: 1200 × 2465 pixels
  - Physical size: 4.00" × 8.22" at 300 DPI
  - Content: Grids 3-5 (DOWN analysis, elimination, and solution)
  - File size: 214 KB
  - ✅ Fits comfortably on 8.5" × 11" with margins (1.28" vertical clearance)

**Pedagogical Continuity:**
The split naturally divides the elimination method lesson:
- **Page 1** teaches listing ACROSS possibilities
- **Page 2** teaches listing DOWN possibilities and finding intersections
- Readers turn the page at a logical breakpoint in the learning sequence

**Implementation:**
Use `diagram_2_page1.png` and `diagram_2_page2.png` for KDP upload. The original `diagram_2.png` is preserved for reference but should NOT be used in the final book layout.

## Usage in Book Layout

These diagrams are referenced in the Chapter 2 text at the following locations:

1. **Diagram 1** - Referenced in "Technique 1: Unique Combinations" section
2. **Diagram 2 (Pages 1-2)** - Referenced in "Technique 2: Elimination Method" section
   - Page 1: Introduction and ACROSS analysis
   - Page 2: DOWN analysis and solution
3. **Diagram 3** - Referenced in "Technique 2: Elimination Method" (cascade effect subsection)
4. **Diagram 4** - Referenced in "Technique 3: Starting Strategies" section
5. **Diagram 5** - Referenced in "Technique 4: Advanced Tips Preview" (intersection analysis)
6. **Diagram 6** - Referenced in "Technique 4: Advanced Tips Preview" (error handling)

## Pedagogical Design

These diagrams are designed to teach solving techniques progressively:

### Diagram 1: Reference Table
- Clean, scannable table format
- Green highlighting for unique combinations (memorize these!)
- Shows both 2-cell and 3-cell runs
- Includes number of options for each sum

### Diagram 2: Elimination Walkthrough (Two-Page Layout)
- **Page 1:** Introduction and ACROSS run analysis (Grids 1-2)
- **Page 2:** DOWN run analysis, intersection finding, and solution (Grids 3-5)
- Step-by-step process with annotations across both pages
- Color-coded intersecting runs
- Shows listing possibilities, checking intersections, and reaching solution
- Builds confidence in the elimination method through progressive disclosure

### Diagram 3: Cascade Effect
- Before/after comparison layout
- Demonstrates the "aha!" moment when one digit unlocks many
- Encourages learners to look for cascade opportunities

### Diagram 4: Starting Strategies
- Visual legend with icons (stars for corners, circles for constraints)
- Multiple color highlights show different strategic entry points
- Teaches where to begin on an empty grid

### Diagram 5: Advanced Preview
- Shows pencil mark notation
- Demonstrates multi-run analysis
- Prepares learners for intermediate-level complexity

### Diagram 6: Error Recovery
- Side-by-side comparison of wrong vs. corrected puzzle
- Detailed annotations explain how to trace the error
- Reduces frustration by teaching troubleshooting

## Color Coding System

Chapter 2 uses an educational color scheme:

- **Light Blue** - Indicates cells in one run (for teaching)
- **Light Yellow** - Indicates cells in another run (for teaching)
- **Light Green** - Shows unique combinations or correct answers
- **Green** - Solved/correct cells
- **Yellow/Orange** - Highlighted information or intermediate steps
- **Red** - Errors or warnings
- **Purple** - Additional runs in complex examples
- **Gray** - Pencil marks or candidate digits

## Print Considerations

All diagrams are optimized for:
- **Black & White Printing:** Uses different shading intensities and patterns
- **Color Printing:** Full color with high contrast
- **Large Print Books:** All fonts are 18px+ for readability
- **8.5×11 Page Size:** Diagrams fit comfortably on standard pages with margins

## Integration Notes

- Each diagram is self-contained (includes title and necessary context)
- Annotations provide additional explanation without cluttering the visual
- Consistent styling with Chapter 1 diagrams for professional cohesion
- Can be resized without losing clarity (vector-like quality at 300 DPI)

**Production Note:** These diagrams complement the Chapter 2 text and should appear near their corresponding text references for optimal learning flow.
