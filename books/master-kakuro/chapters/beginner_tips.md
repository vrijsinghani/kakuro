# Beginner Tips & Tricks
*Mastering the Basics*

Congratulations on completing the Beginner Level! Before moving on to the larger grids, review these key strategies.

## 1. The Power of "16" and "17" with 2 Cells
*   **17 in 2 cells** is always **8+9**.
*   **16 in 2 cells** is always **7+9**.
*   *Why this matters*: These are high-value restrictive combinations that often anchor a corner.

## 2. Corner Logic
When a row and column meet at a corner, valid digits are limited.
*   Example: A "4" row meets a "3" column. The intersection cell MUST be 1, 2, or 3. But since the row sum is 4 (1+3), and column is 3 (1+2), the common cell is highly constrained.

## 3. Don't Guess!
If you find yourself guessing, stop. Look for:
1.  **Unique sums** available elsewhere.
2.  **Cross-checking** vertical vs horizontal possibilities.
3.  **Exclusions**: "This cell cannot be 5 because the row already has a 5."
