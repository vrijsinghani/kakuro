# Chapter 7: Stepping Up
*9x9 Grids - Intermediate Challenges*

Welcome to the Intermediate Level! You are now graduating to 9x9 grids.

**What changes:**
*   **Grid Size**: 9x9 gives you 81 cells to consider, though many are black squares.
*   **Complexity**: Minimum runs are longer. You will see more 4-cell and 5-cell sums.
*   **Interconnectivity**: Sections of the puzzle are less isolated. A decision on the left side might ripple across to the right.

**Focus:**
*   Look for "Bottlenecks" - cells that connect large areas.
*   Memorize 3-cell unique sums (e.g., 6 = 1+2+3, 24 = 7+8+9).
