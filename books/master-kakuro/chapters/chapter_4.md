# Chapter 4: Warm-Up Puzzles
*6x6 Grids - The Journey Begins*

Welcome to the beginner section! These first 20 puzzles are designed to get you comfortable with the mechanics of Kakuro. They use small 6x6 grids, which means the runs are generally shorter and the logic is more straightforward.

**Focus on:**
*   Finding unique combinations (like 3 in two cells = 1+2).
*   Looking for the smallest sums.
*   Checking intersections carefully.
