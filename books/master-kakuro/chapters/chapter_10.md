# Chapter 10: Expert Entry

Welcome to the Expert Level.

You've mastered the fundamentals. You've conquered the intermediate grids. Now, it's time to push further.

The 12×12 grids in this chapter represent a significant step up. Longer runs, more complex intersections, and fewer obvious starting points will test your patience and precision.

## What to Expect

-   **Larger Solution Space:** With more cells, each puzzle offers more paths—and more dead ends.
-   **Deep Chains:** You'll often need to reason 3-4 steps ahead before placing a single digit.
-   **Time Investment:** Plan for 30+ minutes per puzzle.

## Strategy Reminder

1.  **Scan for constraints** - Look for runs with limited combinations (e.g., sums near 3-6 or 38-45 in longer runs).
2.  **Build from certainty** - Only fill cells you can prove.
3.  **Track candidates** - Pencil marks become essential at this level.

Take your time. These puzzles reward careful thinking over speed.
