*11x11 Grids - Multi-Step Reasoning*

This is the final stage before Expert level. 11x11 grids approach full-page complexity.

**Mastering the Flow:**

*   **The "Hollow" Runs**: Long runs with missing middles require you to solve the ends first.

**Goal:**
Complete these puzzles in under 20 minutes to be ready for the huge 12x12+ expert grids.
