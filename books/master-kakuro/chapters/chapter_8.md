# Chapter 8: Intermediate Challenges
*10x10 Grids - Strategic Planning*

As we expand to 10x10 grids, simple scanning is no longer enough. You need strategic planning.

**New Challenges:**
*   **Isolated Sub-regions**: Sometimes a corner is connected by only one run. Solve these first to break into the center.
*   **False Leads**: A run of "10 in 2" (1+9, 2+8, 3+7, 4+6) has many options. Don't commit until you have cross-clues.

**Tip:**
Mark candidates in pencil (or small numbers). At this level, tracking "what *could* go here" is as important as "what *goes* here."
