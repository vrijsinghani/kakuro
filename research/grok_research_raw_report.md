### Key Points on Kakuro Puzzle Book Market on Amazon KDP
- **Market Potential**: Research suggests Kakuro puzzle books have solid demand with around 36,635 monthly searches on Amazon, yet low competition compared to more saturated niches like Sudoku, making it an attractive entry point for new publishers.
- **Competitor Landscape**: Top books often price between $7.99 and $16.61, with page counts from 102 to 320; BSRs range widely (e.g., 742,566 to over 3 million), indicating room for well-optimized listings to rank higher, especially in categories like Logic & Brain Teasers or Puzzles.
- **Keyword Opportunities**: High-volume terms include "kakuro puzzle book" and long-tails like "kakuro for adults" or "easy kakuro puzzles"; focus on low-competition phrases such as "kakuro for seniors large print" to improve visibility.
- **Pricing and Profitability**: For a 300-page 8.5x11 B&W paperback at $9.99, net royalty per sale is approximately $1.54 after printing costs (~$4.45), with higher prices yielding better margins; aim for evergreen content but leverage seasonal spikes around holidays and summer.
- **Trends and Gaps**: Interest in Kakuro remains steady year-round but peaks during school breaks, road trips, and winter holidays; underserved sub-niches like themed or large-print versions for seniors could capture untapped demand amid growing interest in brain-training activities.

### Competitor Insights
Top-performing Kakuro books emphasize variety in difficulty (easy to hard) and large puzzle counts (100+). For example, "Will Shortz Presents Easy Kakuro" (https://www.amazon.com/Will-Shortz-Presents-Easy-Kakuro/dp/0312345410) appeals to beginners with its introductory focus, while "The Massive Book of Kakuro: 1000 Puzzles" (https://www.amazon.com/Massive-Book-Kakuro-1000-Puzzles/dp/1519348045) targets enthusiasts seeking volume. Review themes highlight positives like challenge and enjoyment but criticisms around print size and difficulty balance—opportunities to differentiate with large-print options.

### Keyword and SEO Recommendations
Prioritize terms with balanced search volume and low competition. Autocomplete-inspired phrases like "kakuro puzzles" or "kakuro book" can drive organic traffic. Use tools like Google Keyword Planner for validation, as Kakuro-related searches show growing interest without overwhelming rivalry.

### Profitability Scenarios
Using Amazon KDP's formula (60% royalty minus printing costs), a 300-page B&W book at $9.99 yields modest profits; increasing to $12.99 boosts royalties to ~$3.35 per sale. Consider eBook versions for 70% royalties if digital demand aligns.

### Trend Highlights
Puzzle books see consistent sales but with seasonal uplifts—evidence leans toward higher demand in fall/winter. Emerging gaps include cognitive health-focused niches, where Kakuro fits well as a math-based alternative to Sudoku.

---

The Kakuro puzzle book market on Amazon KDP presents a promising opportunity for publishers, blending steady demand with relatively low competition in a broader puzzle niche that's experiencing sustained growth. As of early 2026, the sector benefits from broader trends in brain-training and mindfulness activities, with the global puzzle book market valued at $189 million in 2025 and projected to grow at a 5.6% CAGR through 2033. This growth is driven by increasing interest in cognitive stimulation, stress reduction, and analog entertainment amid digital fatigue, making Kakuro—an addictive logic puzzle combining elements of crosswords and Sudoku—a strong contender for both evergreen and seasonal sales.

#### Pricing and Profitability Calculations

The printing cost formula is: Fixed cost ($0.85-$1.00 USD for B&W) + (page count × $0.012 per page). For an 8.5x11 trim (large), 300-page B&W book sold on Amazon.com, costs approximate $4.45-$4.60. Note: The document mentions 35% vs. 70% royalties, which apply to eBooks; for paperbacks, focus on print specs.
