- CAGR: **5.6%** through 2033
- Physical books: **95%** of puzzle sales (digital detox trend)

## "Blue Ocean" Niche Gaps

### 1. Large Print for Seniors
**Gap:** Books claim "large print" but reviews complain about small numbers.  
**Opportunity:** True Large Print (16pt+ font, 1-2 puzzles/page) for vision-impaired seniors.  
**Growth:** Senior demographic +18% YoY.

### 2. Kakuro Variations
**Gap:** Most books are standard Kakuro. Enthusiasts want novelty.  
**Opportunity:** Variations like:
- Cross Sums (using 0)
- Consecutive Kakuro (gray dots between consecutive numbers)
- Hexagonal Kakuro

### 3. Tutorial-First Books
**Gap:** Reviews complain puzzles are "too hard" or lack instructions.  
**Opportunity:** "Mastering Kakuro" - 30% tutorial/strategy + 70% puzzles. Teach techniques like "unique sums" (e.g., 3 in 2 cells = always 1+2).

## Emerging Trends

### Digital Detox
- Consumers crave tactile, screen-free experiences
- Marketing angle: "Unplugging" and "Relaxation"

### Cognitive Resilience
- "Brain Health" is not just a keyword — it's a value proposition
- Position Kakuro as tool for "preventing mental decline" or "sharpening focus"
