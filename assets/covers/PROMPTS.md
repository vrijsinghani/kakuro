**Filename:** `assets/covers/master_kakuro_cover_concept_1_[timestamp].png`

**Prompt:**
> A professional book cover design for 'Master Kakuro'. The design should feature a premium color scheme of deep purple and gold. The text 'Master Kakuro' should be large, bold, and easy to read.

The background should be abstract but evoke logic and brain connectivity, perhaps with faint geometric grid patterns or neural network nodes. It should look suitable for a printed paperback book for adults and seniors. High quality, sharp typography.
